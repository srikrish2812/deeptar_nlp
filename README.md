# deeptar_nlp - Task 2 Mainly ML

The hardware used for this project is Macbook M1 pro 16gb ram. The environment creation steps are exclusive to macOS only. Please refer online guide to create a python virtual environment in Windows.

1. Before running the code create a python environment and install all the packages given in the requirements.txt file. Clone the repository and move to the repo directory and run the following commands to reproduce the results
```
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```
2. Once the jupyter notebook home page launches open the Task_2_Mainly_ML.ipynb notebook and run the code.

3. Please do not use google colab as it causes runtime disconnection errors and requires setting up the file system each time the runtime gets disconnected. 

4. The fine-tuned BERT model is not included in the github repository as it 430MB in size. It will be automatically saved in the subtask_3 folder as you run the code under subtask_3 section in the notebook.
